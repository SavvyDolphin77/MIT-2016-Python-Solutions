# MIT-2016-Python-Solutions
My solutions to the problem sets for the MIT OpenCourseWare for Python for their 2016 course as a way for me to learn python.
There are a total of 6 problem sets from 0 to one. The solution is namde pss{number of problem set}.py. Ex: pss3.py is the solution for problem set three. 
To run the program install Python (not verision 2) and go to the file in the cmd (command prompt). Type py {name of file}.py to run it.
